Digital twin technology is a concept that integrates the internet of things (IoT), software analytics, artificial intelligence, and special network graphs to create digital simulation models that replicate physical assets (physical twin).

### What is a Digital Twin?
A digital twin is a digital representation of actual and potential assets, people, processes, systems, devices, and places. This representation provides the dynamics and elements of how an IoT device lives and operates. 

Continuous learning and updates enable the digital twin to provide the real-time position, condition, or status of the real objects. This pairing of the real world and the digital representation enable organizations to monitor systems, develop plans and anticipate problems before they occur.

### Why Digital Technology is Important
Digital technology should be considered by organizations for various reasons. It enables companies to develop a digital footprint of the entire product life cycle. This ensures that they have an in-depth understanding of the actual product and the process that was used to design the product. The digital twin created by a company enables it to drive value through improved models and reduced defects. 

A Digital twin enables a company to detect problems in a product or manufacturing process. Through digital technology, outcomes can be predicted effectively with a high level of accuracy. With this technology, there is faster  realization of value than before. 

### Characteristics of Digital Twin Technology
Digital twin technology consists of certain characteristics such as connectivity, homogenization, ability to be reprogammable, digital traces and modularity. 

#### Connectivity
In digital twin technology, connectivity is enhanced between physical assets and their digital counterparts. Sensors that are attached to physical objects are used to enhance connectivity with digital representations. Data from the physical components is obtained and integrated by these sensors. Integration technologies enable the sensors to communicate the collected data.
  
#### Homogenization
Digital technology is also characterized by the homogenization of data from physical components. This means that a digital representation that is similar to the physical object can be created using the collected data. This technology can also enable data to be decoupled from the physical artifacts.  
  
#### Reprogrammable
A digital twin can enable the replicated physical product to be reprogrammed. This can be used as the basis for creating new versions of the initial product. A good example is in the case of engines. A digital twin for a current engine can be reprogrammed to improve fuel efficiency and productivity. 
  
#### Digital traces
This technology consists of digital traces that are left when creating a digital twin. Digital traces are used by engineers in the diagnosis of problems when machines break down.

#### Modularity
Digital technology enhances the customization of digital production modules. This enables manufacturers to modify their models. Modularity in digital technology enables manufacturers to identify areas that need improvement.

### How Digital Technology Works
The Digital twin a of a manufacturing process can give us a good overview of how digital technology works. In this case, the digital twin provides a virtual representation of what happens in the factory in real-time. The following diagram shows the digital twin model of an actual manufacturing process.

The digital twin model is achieved through six main features-sensors, actuators, data, integration, analytics, and the digital twin. 

- **Sensors:** Sensors are positioned at various points of the physical manufacturing process to collect data. Some of the important dimensions of data collected include works in progress (including speed, thickness, and color quality), environmental conditions of the factory, and behavioral characteristics of machines.
  
- **Data:** This is the information collected from the physical processes. The main data collected includes operational and environmental data. This data is aggregated and combined with other enterprise data such as design specifications, enterprise systems, engineering drawings, and customer logs.  
  
- **Interaction:** Interactive technology enhances the interaction between the physical processes and the digital representation of these processes. This technology enables sensors to communicate the aforementioned data to the virtual (digital) world. Some of the integration technologies used include edge, security, and communication interfaces.   
  
- **Analytics:** Incoming data is continuously analyzed by the digital twin application. Data is analyzed through visualization routines and algorithmic simulations. Digital twins produce insights using this analysis. This analysis ensures the actual manufacturing process takes place seamlessly. It also identifies unacceptable trends in this process.
  
- **Digital Twin:** This is the digital replica of the actual manufacturing processes. It is shown on the right side of the diagram.  
  
- **Actuators:** If there is any need for action in the actual process, the digital twin will use actuators to generate the action. 

### Applications of Digital Twin Technology
The digital twin technology is applied in various industries. The following are some of the applications of this technology.

#### Manufacturing
Digital twins are used for replicating the physical processes in manufacturing companies. Digital technology enhances the interaction of the virtual objects and the physical objects in the factory. When there are problems in the actual physical processes, engineers assess the digital twin to trace the origin and nature of the problem. Digital twins in manufacturing can also be used to improve processes. 
  
#### Health care
Through digital twin technology, personalized models can be created by health professionals to improve medical care. These professionals can use the digital twin of organs or patients (instead of real patients) to practice important health procedures. 
  
#### Urban Planning
Digital twin technology is important in the planning of smart urban cities. Digital twins are used for modeling urban cities and related data. This technology has also enhanced the digitization of related activities such as construction, maintenance, and operation of urban projects. The built project is integrated with its digital representation to enhance optimal performance.

#### Automotive industry
Automobile companies use digital twin technology to create digital twins of their cars. These digital twins enable these companies to showcase how real cars operate. In case improvements are needed in the current car models, engineers will use the digital twins to suggest new features that can improve their performance.

#### Logistics/Supply Chain
Digital twin technology enables companies to virtualize their product packages before the actual packaging takes place. This helps in reducing errors in packaging. Logistics companies can also use this type of technology to assess material feasibility, design effective warehouse layouts, and create feasible logistics networks.
  
### The Future of Digital Twin Technology
Digital twin technology is driving optimal performance and innovation in various industries. In the coming years, there will be many digital twins representing various physical realities such as people, processes, places, and objects. This may call for more collaboration between experts who handle physical products and data scientists.
